I would like to thank my supervisor Helge Pfeiffer for his expert guidance and sage advice during the course of this project. Additionally, a huge thank you to Julian Priest, Sebastian BÃ¼ttrich and Inna Ermilova for inviting me into the DASYA lab, helping me with trivial and challenging problems and entertaining discussions about my thesis, the universe and everything in between.

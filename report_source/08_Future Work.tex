\fancyhead[R]{Python Application Energy Consumption}
\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:futurework}
While this thesis investigates a large number of unique configurations, its scope is still very narrow when compared to the number of programming languages and software and hardware configurations used globally. In the short term, adding more models of Raspberry Pi to the presented experiment would already be a substantial improvement. In the long term, we would like to expand the methodology presented here to a wider array of real-world execution environments. Echoing Pfeiffer, establishing a standard applicative benchmark in several languages and testing it on a large number of realistic configurations would be a substantial contribution to the GSE initiative. Additionally, there are grounds for more research into narrow, specific causes of differences in performance and energy consumption between both Python versions and OSs. Especially, the impact of the C library appears to be an interesting avenue of research. Such research would help identify the actual reasons behind the differences observed in this thesis.
